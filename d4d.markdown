How efficient a city is, how to make the city more efficient, might be an important question to its administrators and all of its residents. The most obvious efficiency will be the commuting efficiency, which will affect the experience of working people and energy saving of the city.
However, in Africa, high quality data is quite limited. But the digital “footprints” such as call detailed records give us a clue. In this article, we mainly focus on these two aspects. We introduce  a  method  to  identify  users’  home  and  work  places  from   mobile phone data, and then we analysis the day and night, local and non-local population distribution in Dakar, the capital of Senegal. We show the dynamical patterns of human mobility and  ‘hotspots’  defined by population density. We  combine  the  users’  records with road network data, and get the regression coefficient and mismatched region between population density and road density in Dakar. We also introduced a road network efficiency indicator, which provides a quantitative measure to guide transportation infrastructure development. Above all, the traffic flow patterns, ‘hotspots’  and  mishmatched  regions could all be scientific basis for the government to make future urban planning policies.
